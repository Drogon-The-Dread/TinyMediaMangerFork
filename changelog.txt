Version 4.1
=======================
+ BIG scraper rework:
  We splitted up all scrapers into individual sub-scrapers for every scope (meta data, artwork, trailer, subtitle).
  This offers new options to configure them:
    - now they are all independently configurable (no setting for the movie section influences the TV show section)
    - we could strip out options which are not needed for the actual section (e.g. TV show options in the movie scraper)
    - they have a better code base for future changes
  The only drawback here is, that you may have to enter some options (like an individual API key) in every sub-scraper
  ATTENTION: since almost everything changed in the scraper setup, you may need to re-set the scraper options after the update

x exchanged native file dialogs with tiny file dialogs
  Windows users will see a change here, because tiny file dialogs uses the "folder browser" component from Windows
x better error messages for SSL errors #1122
